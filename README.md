# GitHub Actions Example

This repository contains an example of how to use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

## Getting Started

To get started with GitHub Actions, you'll need to create a workflow file in the `.github/workflows` directory of your repository.

## Example Workflow

Here is an example of a simple workflow file:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
    build:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest

        steps:
        - name: Checkout code
            uses: actions/checkout@v2

        - name: Set up Node.js
            uses: actions/setup-node@v2
            with:
                node-version: '14'

        - name: Install dependencies
            run: npm install

        - name: Run tests
            run: npm test
```
